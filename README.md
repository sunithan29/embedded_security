Secure Communication and Firewall Architecture for IoT Applications
* Decentralizing authentication and authorization in embedded devices
Devised a novel approach to resolve centralized authentication and authorization for
embedded devices by off-loading these processes to the local Certifying Authority
server

* Firewall Architecture for IoT Applications
Proposed a dynamic firewall architecture that out-performs conventional (DTLS)
architecture for IoT applications and is proven to be effective against DOS flood
attacks
